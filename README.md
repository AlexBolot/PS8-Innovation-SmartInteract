Project subject

Making a game-engine to include Natural Language Processing in video games.

Video-games can interact with our solution by sending the player's message, and we send back the appropriate reply.

We target two types of users :

- Game Designer (working on dialogues, script and characters)
Their job is to create `Characters`, give them some `Knowledge`, test if they match the expected behaviour and monitor the `Character's` reactions (what's in their mind)

- Game Developper (coding the rest of the game)
Their job is to plug our solution to the game they create, no matter the coding language they use (`C, C++, Java, Python, etc`)

```
Important : the video-game players are NOT our direct users.
We provide a tool for companies to create games on their own and sell them to players.
```
